      <p>
        Hi! I’m Vishal, a passionate Full Stack Developer and a B.Sc. Statistics
        undergraduate at PSG College of Arts & Science, Coimbatore. I love
        transforming ideas into interactive, user-friendly web applications. My
        journey into coding started with curiosity about how websites and apps
        work — and now, I enjoy building them using modern web technologies. I
        specialize in JavaScript, Node.js, React, and Express, and I have
        experience working with MongoDB and REST APIs. I’ve also built projects
        like a Bookstore Application and a Movie Search Website, where I focused
        on seamless UI and efficient backend logic. Beyond coding, I’m
        analytical and data-driven — my statistics background helps me think
        logically and make informed decisions while solving complex problems. I
        enjoy learning new technologies and constantly improving my skills to
        stay updated in the fast-paced tech world. My goal is to become a
        skilled full stack developer who builds scalable, creative, and
        impactful applications that make a real difference.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I love turning ideas into interactive, functional, and visually
        appealing applications.
